## Change simulations to calculate error rates

13th July 2023

I want to change the simulations to calculate how reliable paternity is when
there are missing fathers. 

The most likely father for a single offspring can be the real father (F), an 
unrelated father (U), or a missing father (M). Then we want to know:
* P(F|F) that the true father is the most likely given that he is present
* P(U|F) that an unrelated father is the most likely, when F is present
* P(M|F) that a father is assigned missing when he is present
* P(M|M) that a missing father is correctly assigned as missing
* P(U|M) that an unrelated father is the most likely, when F is not sampled

I added calculation of P(F|F) to the simulations.
I realised that they already calculate P(M|F), and P(U|F) = 1- P(F|F) - P(M|F).
I can get P(M|M) and P(U|M) from the numbers of orphans, also already in the code.

Also repeated the inference of mating events using only 500 iterations as
burnin.

## Tidy MCMC analyses

13th July 2023

Simplified the folder of MCMC results.

* Removed the analyses using missing fathers = 0.22 and 0.42
* Changed 04_no_mixture to 02_no_mixture
* Removed all the output files, because tracking them will really slow down the
git repo...

## Fiddling

Minor formatting changes.

Tried plotting things with and without singletons families.

Corrected paths to MCMC results

## no_mixture MCMC with q=0.5

28th June 2023

Ran the MCMC for the model with lambda=1 with proportion of missing fathers set
to 0.5 (see f70f1200ae95c8e63ff76ef0e945631dec6382bb).

Corrected typos in the main MCMC analysis.

## Set hard prior on q to 0.5

30th May 2023

Set the prior on the pro portion of missing fathers to a hard prior of 0.5.
This sets equal prior weight on probability mass from sampled and unsampled
candidates, meaning that the signal all comes from the data. I also set this up
to run as a parallel batch job.

This is because when q is allowed to vary the model moves straight to q=1 -
everyone is compatible with a missing father, so this solution has high
likelihood. I also don't like running separate analyses for different values of
q because this becomes very cumbersome to run and present, and doesn't really 
change much. Instead, I'll discuss other ways to establish who the proportion of
missing fathers.

This is initially done for the 'main' MCMC to check it works. Still need to 
repeat this for a model with no mixture, and possibly include assortment.

## Simulations with missing fathers

25th May 2023

Added function to remove a sample of real fathers from simulated data and
see what happens to paternity assignment of the offspring. This calculates how
many offspring are affected, how many are correctly assigned as having missing 
dads, and how many are falsely assigned to families of size = 1.

This splits up the original simulation function to first generate the genotype
data and calculate a paternity array, then use separate functions to calculate
paternity accuracy (what the previous simulations were doing) and do the stuff
with missing dads.

This is done for only 200 iterations of the MCMC, because this will be much slower.

## MCMC with simplified priors

17th May 2023

Ran the MCMC jobs with simpler priors.
For the analysis with mixture set to 1 I had to change the beta prior to a 
fixed value, or else the log posterior came back as undefined.

## Simplify the priors

3rd April 2023

I previously presented three contrasting prior scenarios. I think this makes for
a complicated presentation and doesn't really add much. I replaced this with a
single set of less informative priors that place equal weight on leptokurtosis
vs not. I will still keep the comparison with analyses using different values 
for missing fathers, and keeping lambda fixed.

I got this far, and submitted the MCMC job:
- Update prior_sims.Rmd
- Update prior sims in supplementary figures
- Remove the old MCMC analyses and do it again.

Still to do:
- Repeat mating events based on new MCMC output
- Repeat simulations based on new mating events
- Update the supplementary figures with MCMC results
- Update main figures
- Fix the text

## Relatedness

January-ish 2023

Attempted to see whether a linear measure of relatedness between parents
explains anything about mating patterns. I don't think it does.

## Removed estimate of missing fathers

I realised the inference of the number of families with missing fathers was 
dubious, and I don't trust the results. If necessary I can do something later
with FAPS to address this.

I removed this, and just included the raw estimates from FAPS (from 
summarise_mating.csv files). I will put in the text that this is a lower bound, 
because we don't know how many families there really are.

## Supplementary figures

11th Nov 2022

Added supplementary figures.

Moved plot of sibship probabilities to SI.

Added sundry files I hadn't added before for some reason.

## Updated main figures

11th November 2022

Moved distributions of number of mating events and proporting missing fathers
to its own figure. Posterior plot now only summarises shape, scale and mixture.

Changed numbering of other figures accordingly.

## Latex manuscript

10th November 2022

Added files to create the manuscript. Tidied figure folders and changed these
to output EPS figures to 05_manuscript so they are in the same place as the 
.tex files.

## Code for 3 figures

Added code to plot the map, summaries of posterior distributinos with means and
96% CIs,  and figures describing dispersal events (histogram, cumulative curve,
summaries of median dispersal and sires >500m from the mother).

Edited README to detail the function used to plot weighted cumulative curves.

## Removed missing fathers from simulations

3rd November 2022

Removed the lines from simulation module that removes true fathers. I don't
think it's doing what I think its doing, and it's not a priority to present.

Added README for the simulations.

## Plot mating events

27th October 2022

Added analysis and plots for the relationship between array size and number of
sibships, and used this to infer the number of missing fathers.

The latter is based on a GLM using mating events averaged over iterations. There
is some funkiness with mating events with <2 offspring which I think I spurious.
This might be worth repeating using a separate GLM for each iteration.

## Power analysis simulations

27th October 2022

Added library code and script to run power analysis simulations.

This simulates mating events between mothers and real candidate father
genotypes, and generates families of full siblings of the same sizes as in 
the real data set. This then runs FAPS functions on those data and returns
probabilities of paternity for true sires based on paternity alone, after
clustering into sibships, and after clustering including information about
dispersal.

It also returns the posterrior probs that true fathers were missing (1) when 
they are really present and (2) when they are truly missing.


## Many small changes

27th October 2022

- `setup_FAPS_GPS.py` changed to save GPS positions and maternal family sizes.
 `02_library/python/amajusmating/mating.py` changed to include option to set
    mixture to 1 by default. I should probably remove this and have scripts 
    set this as necessary so this isn't implicit.
- `README` updated to explain data formatting better.
- `03_analysis/02_prior_simulations/prior_simulations.Rmd` small changes to text
- `03_analysis/03_mcmc/01_mcmc_restrict_kurtosis/run_MCMC.py` small change to 
    order scale before shape.
`03_analysis/03_mcmc/job_submission.sh` updated to allow for a long job over 8 days
`03_analysis/04_mating_events/get_mating_events.py` rearranged some arguments



## Mating events
7th October 2022
Added files to infer mating events between individual mothers and pollen donors.

## MCMC analyses
7th October 2022
Copied over existing MCMC scripts, and added two more testing different values
for the proportion of missing fathers. Added a SLURM submission script and 
sent to check it works on a cluster. Also added a README.

## Prior simulations

6th October 2022

Added Rmd file for prior sims.

## Initial commit

6.10.22

Initial commit of manuscript files.

Copied data and library code from the working directory.

Updated paths and added progress print statements in data formatting script.

## 5.10.22

I am setting up a folder to hold code for a manuscript repo. I want it to look 
something like this:

library:
    data class
    mcmc
    dispersal
    mating
    simulations

heavy lifting:
    set-up script
    mcmc in many flavours
    mating patterns (list of mating events)
        Need to check how I defined support for mating events - partitions or paternity?
    simulations
    signal from sibships vs covariates

figures:
    map
    dispersal:
        histogram
        cumulative
        show for flower colour separately?
    simulations

supplementary:
    prior simulations
    posterior output
    anisotropy
