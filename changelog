# Change log

## Added assortative mating back in

12th November

Added lines in the dictionaries for inital parameters and proposal sigmas to 
include assortment in the MCMC analyses (most of the code to do that was there
already, lurking behind if statements).

I also added three lines to `check_parameters()` and `run_MCMC()` to include 
an estimate of the 'null assortmemt', or the probability of mating between
plants of the same type under random mating, given current dispersal parameters.

## Removed estimate of missing fathers

I realised the inference of the number of families with missing fathers was 
dubious, and I don't trust the results. If necessary I can do something later
with FAPS to address this.

I removed this, and just included the raw estimates from FAPS (from 
summarise_mating.csv files). I will put in the text that this is a lower bound, 
because we don't know how many families there really are.

## Supplementary figures

11th Nov 2022

Added supplementary figures.

Moved plot of sibship probabilities to SI.

Added sundry files I hadn't added before for some reason.

## Updated main figures

11th November 2022

Moved distributions of number of mating events and proporting missing fathers
to its own figure. Posterior plot now only summarises shape, scale and mixture.

Changed numbering of other figures accordingly.

## Latex manuscript

10th November 2022

Added files to create the manuscript. Tidied figure folders and changed these
to output EPS figures to 05_manuscript so they are in the same place as the 
.tex files.

## Code for 3 figures

Added code to plot the map, summaries of posterior distributinos with means and
96% CIs,  and figures describing dispersal events (histogram, cumulative curve,
summaries of median dispersal and sires >500m from the mother).

Edited README to detail the function used to plot weighted cumulative curves.

## Removed missing fathers from simulations

3rd November 2022

Removed the lines from simulation module that removes true fathers. I don't
think it's doing what I think its doing, and it's not a priority to present.

Added README for the simulations.

## Plot mating events

27th October 2022

Added analysis and plots for the relationship between array size and number of
sibships, and used this to infer the number of missing fathers.

The latter is based on a GLM using mating events averaged over iterations. There
is some funkiness with mating events with <2 offspring which I think I spurious.
This might be worth repeating using a separate GLM for each iteration.

## Power analysis simulations

27th October 2022

Added library code and script to run power analysis simulations.

This simulates mating events between mothers and real candidate father
genotypes, and generates families of full siblings of the same sizes as in 
the real data set. This then runs FAPS functions on those data and returns
probabilities of paternity for true sires based on paternity alone, after
clustering into sibships, and after clustering including information about
dispersal.

It also returns the posterrior probs that true fathers were missing (1) when 
they are really present and (2) when they are truly missing.


## Many small changes

27th October 2022

- `setup_FAPS_GPS.py` changed to save GPS positions and maternal family sizes.
 `02_library/python/amajusmating/mating.py` changed to include option to set
    mixture to 1 by default. I should probably remove this and have scripts 
    set this as necessary so this isn't implicit.
- `README` updated to explain data formatting better.
- `03_analysis/02_prior_simulations/prior_simulations.Rmd` small changes to text
- `03_analysis/03_mcmc/01_mcmc_restrict_kurtosis/run_MCMC.py` small change to 
    order scale before shape.
`03_analysis/03_mcmc/job_submission.sh` updated to allow for a long job over 8 days
`03_analysis/04_mating_events/get_mating_events.py` rearranged some arguments



## Mating events
7th October 2022
Added files to infer mating events between individual mothers and pollen donors.

## MCMC analyses
7th October 2022
Copied over existing MCMC scripts, and added two more testing different values
for the proportion of missing fathers. Added a SLURM submission script and 
sent to check it works on a cluster. Also added a README.

## Prior simulations

6th October 2022

Added Rmd file for prior sims.

## Initial commit

6.10.22

Initial commit of manuscript files.

Copied data and library code from the working directory.

Updated paths and added progress print statements in data formatting script.

## 5.10.22

I am setting up a folder to hold code for a manuscript repo. I want it to look 
something like this:

library:
    data class
    mcmc
    dispersal
    mating
    simulations

heavy lifting:
    set-up script
    mcmc in many flavours
    mating patterns (list of mating events)
        Need to check how I defined support for mating events - partitions or paternity?
    simulations
    signal from sibships vs covariates

figures:
    map
    dispersal:
        histogram
        cumulative
        show for flower colour separately?
    simulations

supplementary:
    prior simulations
    posterior output
    anisotropy
