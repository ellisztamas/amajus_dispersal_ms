def import_mcmc(folder, burnin, mixture_is_1 = True):
    """
    Import and trim multiple files with MCMC output for A. majus mating
    parameters.

    This looks in a folder with one or more files containing the output of 
    amajusmating.mating.run_MCMC(), which end with `.out`, usually from separate
    chains from the same analysis. It imports these, and removes entries from 
    the first entries as burnin, then concatenates remaining steps into a single
    dataframe.

    Parameters
    ==========
    folder: str
        Path to a directory containing one or more files from 
        amajusmating.mating.run_MCMC ending with the suffix `.out`
    burnin: int
        Integer number of rows to remove from each chain as burnin

    Returns
    =======
    A single dataframe concatenating data from the imported chains. Since we are
    interested in dispersal parameters, the `mixture` parameter is set to 1 for
    all rows.

def get_mating_events(data, model, max_distance = np.inf):
    """
    Generate a dataframe of mating events between mothers and plausible 
    candidate fathers, along with posterior support for each event having
    happened.

    This calls `faps.summarise_sires()` using observed genotype and dispersal
    data. For each maternal family, this pulls out a list of the plausible
    fathers associated with each possible partition structure, and the posterior
    probability of that structure. The probability of a mating event between the
    mother and an individual candidate father is then the sum of those 
    probabilities for each partition structure in which he appears.

    Likewise the number of offspring sired is the weighted mean number of
    offspring assigned to that father across partition structures, weighted by 
    the posterior probabilty of each partition.

    Parameters
    ==========
    data: `faps_data` class object
        Data about the population.
    model: dict
        Dictionary of starting model parameters. Keys should be a subset of
        ['missing', 'shape', 'scale', 'mixture', 'assortment'] and values 
        floats giving initial values for those parameters, within appropriate
        boundaries.
    max_distance: float, int
        Maximum distance from the mother a candidate may be. Candidates further
        than this value will have their posterior probability of paternity set 
        to zero. This is equivalent to setting a threshold prior on distance.
        Not used.
