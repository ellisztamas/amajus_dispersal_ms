Power analysis simulations.

This simulates mating events between mothers and real candidate father
genotypes, and generates families of full siblings of the same sizes as in 
the real data set. This then runs FAPS functions on those data and returns
probabilities of paternity for true sires based on paternity alone, after
clustering into sibships, and after clustering including information about
dispersal.
