Script to import and format genotype and phenotype information.

Since FAPS uses various classes to deal with these data that aren't easily
stored as a text file, this script is run every time a subsequent analysis is
run. Genotype and phenotype data are stored into a single object called `am_data`
which is a `faps_data` class (see `02_library/python/amajusdata/faps_data.py`).
This is just a placeholder to keep the various datasets in one place, and also 
includes several functions to update parameters for paternity data such as the
proportion of missing fathers.
