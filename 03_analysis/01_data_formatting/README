Script to import and format genotype and phenotype information.

Since FAPS uses various classes to deal with these data that aren't easily
stored as a text file, this script is run every time a subsequent analysis is
run. Genotype and phenotype data are stored into a single object called 
`am_data` which is a `faps_data` class (see 
`02_library/python/amajusdata/faps_data.py`).
This is just a placeholder to keep the various datasets in one place, and also 
includes several functions to update parameters for paternity data such as the
proportion of missing fathers, or to run sibship clustering for each maternal
family separately.
