#' Script to predict the number of mating events detected as a function of how
#' many progeny were included in the maternal array using a Poisson GLM, using
#' progeny with an identifiable father only.
#' 
#' Second, the script uses that GLM to predict how many separate full sibships
#' there are among progeny with an unidentified (unsampled) father.
