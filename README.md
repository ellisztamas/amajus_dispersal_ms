### Python

A conda environment file `environment.yml` is provided to make sure other users can use the same packages as were used to run the original analyses.
Assuming `conda` is installed on your machine (instructions [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)), install the environment with

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate it before running analyses with
```
conda activate faps

```
